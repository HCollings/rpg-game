## rpg-game ##

A work-in-progress project.

The game is a tile-based, 2d rpg.

### The Player ###

Player movement is tile based, but is still not finished. Need to add animation when moving.

### The Level ###

Levels are drawn out in a .map file. Each tile has a corresponding id and character (found in key.txt). The id is the tile's position from left to right in tiles.png (starting from 0).
